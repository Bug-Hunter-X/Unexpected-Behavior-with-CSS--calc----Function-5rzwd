The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but if you have a syntax error or use unsupported units, it can lead to unexpected behavior.  For example, forgetting a space between values or using an invalid unit like `pxx` can break the calculation.  Another issue can arise when nesting `calc()` expressions incorrectly, which can lead to miscalculations.  Using `calc()` with variables that have not been defined properly can also be a source of errors.
